# RefineMobile :crystal_ball:
A Demo Mobile app for X-Ray Refine. This application complies a model of the apps installed on a phone that consists of Usage statistics as well as 3rd party data requested from [SOCIAM's](sociam.org) App Observatory. It provides the users with the opportunity to investigate their exposure to 3rd parties, whilst providing the chance to see how alternative applications may change and improve their exposure to data sharing practices.

## Project Structure :milky_way:
A somewhat typical app structure, there are 3 main activities at the moment, as well as some supporting Layouts. There are also additional Java Classes used to provide some structure to the app, including an ```AppDataModel``` and ```XRayJsonReader```.

**Main Activities/Views.**

```MainActivity```: is where the app goes to when it has finished loading and retrieving app data from the phone and XRay API.

```ListApplications```: Is an intermediate activity that provides a searchable list of all apps installed on the user's Phone.

```AppDetailView```: An activity used to provide a detailed view on the selected app, including usage stats and host information.

**Supporting Activities/Views**

```splash_screen```: A layout used as a splash screen with the ```MainActivity```.

```nav_header```/```drawer_menu```: Layouts used with ```MainActivity``` to form a nav menu

**Additional Classes**

```AppDataModel```: Singleton class that holds all app data used throughout the app. Primarily consists of 3 ```HashMap``` objects, each using an App's Package Name as the key. The 3 hash maps are ```xRayApps```, ```allPhoneAppInfos```, ```trackedPhoneAppInfos```

```XRayJsonReader```: The XRay App observatory is implemented as a REST API only supporting JSON. This JsonReader provides methods for parsing a Json response from an API Query.

```AppInfo```: A soon to be Deprecated class used to hold app info retrieved from the User's phone and not from the XRay API. Will be replaced with ```XRayApp```.

```XRayApp```: A data class holding app information requested from the XRay API. Uses ```XRayAppStoreInfo``` to hold the store info data requested for an app from the XRay API. Note: This class will replace the ```AppInfo``` class.

## API Requests :satellite:

API Requests are currently using Cached data located at [negi.io](negi.io). The string used to indicate where the app should direct requests is in the ```string.xml``` file. To change where the app requests data from, edit the ```xray_apps``` entry

```
<string name="xray_apps">https://negi.io/api/apps</string>
```
